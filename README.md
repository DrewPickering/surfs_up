# Challenge Amazing Prime
Surf and Shake Shop 

Oahu Island weather data analysis conducted to support the decision of opening a surf shop, with the intent to determine that the shop would be successful year round and not just seasonally.

  •	Key statistical data about the month of June.
 
  •	Key statistical data about the month of December.
 
  •	Findings compared between the month of June and December.
     o	Weather in Oahu remains pleasant both in June and December.  On rainfall in December versus June increases by 50% from 0.2 inches         to 0.3 inches per day.  Temperatures at the mean December versus June are about 4 degrees cooler, but remain in the mid-seventies.  
  •	Recommendations for further analysis.
    o	Analyze key weather data for all months of the year (individually) to verify that weather remains pleasant in every month, and/or to        identify any months with significant difference in rainfall and temperatures.
    o	Investigate data sources for tourism peak seasons, and correlate to weather patterns.  Airline, Hotels, Restaurants.  
    o	Airline data provides origin data, perhaps there is a correlation between weather at origin with when certain regions produce             tourists to Hawaii
